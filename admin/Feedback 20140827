From Donald:
The only thing I’d change if possible is that some of the links have a navigation bar of sorts at the bottom 
that lets you move on to the next graphic or back to the overview, and others don’t. 
Not sure if this is a “website in development and will be fixed” issue or 
is browser specific (Safari 7.06 on OSX 10.9.4 just in case)

From Ranjan:
Please mention in your page regarding the clinical experince here. 
Most of affected people now only exposing to health system after the war. 
Some facial deformities ,clef lip and palate are presented with complicated mannar and had been undiagnosed. 
Oral and pharyngeal is a epidemic here. 
Some of the rare cases are commonly seen here in which you can't find n Oxford books.
so clinical materials are very much massive.  
I started doing Botox,rhinoplasty ,face lif ,blephroplasty even though this is rural area. 
My centre is a regional for managing birth defects ,cleft lip and cleft palate.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS!!!
From Michael Stechman:
Two things: on my NHS PC, I couldn’t get the map function to work and second, 
the comments and stories sections only had a couple of examples – 
I presume that they will be added to or is it the NHS firewall?!
