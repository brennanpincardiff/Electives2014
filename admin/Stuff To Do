Sam
    Sam asked about company information. 
    Decide where to host the pages? External or internal site. 

Paul - most important things:
    Add Andrew's info to database
    Edit Andrew's comments into a first author piece
    Add Andrew's content, including a picture, to web page

    Upload and try to get to work on Blackboard. 
    Allow other feedback and comments.
    Make contact with Allan on Tuesday. 


Less important but worthwhile improvements:
    Advice page - can be made more efficient.
    Add Cardiff University Logo 
    Add Facebook Button
    Add Twitter Button
    Overlapping dots on Detailed Map
        I don't like the tooltip format on the Detailed Map.

    Change graphs (particularly advice graph) into horizontal format? 
    Add information about helpful people?
    
    Could add more quotes about highlights - currently 10, could add all 75?
    Refactor maps
