Dear Paul,

Had a look through the website in a bit more detail and had a couple of things that could possibly be edited:
Done:   1. On the bar chart for the ‘Did you feel safe on Elective’ I wasn’t sure about the maybe.. sentence that pops up. Could it instead be something along the lines of “These results were collected from the 75 students who replied but do not represent the whole year group”. 
Done:   2. On the highlights page is there anyway that the quotes could somehow stand out or differ from the other text on the page. Possibly in a slighter small font and against a white background. Alternatively we had the idea of them changing with possibly 2 or 3 rotating/ floating. Not sure how easy that is (sounds hard) - wasn’t sure about the lots of text in 1 go at the top in terms of visual appeal.
Done: 3. On the low points page the word doodle is quite small relative to the other parts - could it be made bigger?
Nothing to do here: 4. advice page looks good and really like the way that the comments boxes pop up directly above the bar chart.


Answered already: Following your schedule: happy to circulate comments to Becky, Michael, Derek, Donald and Nick - do you want me to forward the link or would you like to circulate? I am around tomorrow and Wed if Allan comes back for us to meet up but then on A/L.

All being well - with comments back and pages updated should be on track for release date of 1st Sept if we can sort out the best place to host.

Thanks again for all your work on this - I know I say it a lot but really do appreciate all the work that you have done with it and really really pleased with how it has progressed from this initial ideas!

Best wishes

Sam
