        <h3>Rebuilding after war - our experience in northern Sri Lanka</h3>
            Andrew Vulliamy &amp; Nick Mitchell

            <h4>Vavuniya - a post conflict setting </h4>
               <p>Our elective was located in the general hospital in Vavuniya, often referred 
                  to as the “gateway to the North” of Sri Lanka. During the Sri Lankan civil war from 1983 
                  to 2009, the Tamils fought for increased freedom and autonomy against the 
                  Sinhalese government. Vavuniya was the front line town between the LTTE (Tamil Tigers) 
                  and the Sri Lankan Army until the Army began advancing northwards during the offensive 
                  in 2008. It was also the location of Manik farm following the war, one of the largest 
                  Internally Displaced Peoples camps in the world, where thousands of Tamil civilians 
                  were held after escaping the warzone.</p>
                <p>Since the war has ended Vavuniya remains a predominantly Tamil town. It is heavily 
                    patrolled by Sinhalese soldiers. Army camps surrounded by barbed wire and sand bagged 
                    watchtowers offer a sense that tensions have not completely resolved. </p>
            <h4>The hospital and our host</h4>
                <p><a href="http://www.generalhospitalvavuniya.lk/"> Vavuniya General Hospitial </a> is a surprisingly 
                    large hospital with over 600 beds, a four bed ITU and four operating theatres. It serves a population of 100,000 people. We also 
                    visited peripheral hospitals in Mallaitivu and Jaffna. </p>
                <p>First impressions were that it was a very well run hospital that was clearly recovering 
                    well from the conflict with thanks to the medical superintendent Dr Sathiyamoorthy. 
                    Smartly dressed doctors and nurses in starched white uniforms were working incredibly 
                    hard for their patients who were present in huge numbers often seen as two or three per bed.</p> 
                <p> They showed us a recently acquired CT scanner following a donation from the Indian government. 
                    However, despite the access to relatively advanced facilities, a basic CRP or troponin was 
                    not available.</p>
                <p> We stayed in a two bedroom bungalow in the grounds of the hospital - usually reserved for 
                    visiting consultants. The accommodation was basic but had everything that we needed 
                    for 4 weeks - including a gentleman who brought us tea and breakfast every morning!</p>
                <p> Our host was Dr Ranjan Mallawarachchi, the only maxillofacial surgeon in the north of 
                    Sri Lanka. He is very enthusiastic to create a mutual relationship between Cardiff Medical 
                    School and Vavuniya hospital and welcomes future medical students. He can be contacted by 
                    <a href="mailto: mallawaarachchi95@yahoo.com">email</a>.</p>

                <h4>  Highlights of our elective </h4>
                <p>Being able to see and learn from staff working in a medical system in post conflict Sri Lanka 
                    was a genuine privilege. We were given first hand insights into the war that visitors as 
                    tourists would not see. The highlight was the generosity of the Sri Lankans and the unique 
                    way they would go out of their way to make you feel at home.</p>
